## Introduction
Financial data analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding market trends, forecasting future movements, and making informed investment decisions. This notebook aims to provide a practical guide to analyzing financial data using Python.

## Data Cleaning
The first step in any data analysis project is cleaning the data. This notebook demonstrates how to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

## Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is essential for understanding patterns and making predictions. This section includes techniques such as:
- Stationarity tests (ADF test)
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots (ACF/PACF)
- ARIMA modeling

## PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps in identifying the most significant features and visualizing data in a lower-dimensional space. This notebook demonstrates how to apply PCA and interpret the results.

## HRP
Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) is a method for portfolio allocation that considers the hierarchical structure of asset returns. This section covers the implementation of HRP to optimize a financial portfolio.

## Conclusion
The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings and their implications for financial decision-making. It highlights the key insights gained from the analysis and potential future directions for further study.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- pmdarima
- numpy
- arch
- scikit-learn
- scipy
